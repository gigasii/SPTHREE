7. Need to show the amount of Invisibiliy Scrolls player has in HUD

Highscore bugs:

1. If you enter another name when the list is full (10), the game will break if you gain points
2. If you enter a name that's already in the list, you'll take over his spot.
3. Align the highscore to the middle of the screen, my OCD killing me.
